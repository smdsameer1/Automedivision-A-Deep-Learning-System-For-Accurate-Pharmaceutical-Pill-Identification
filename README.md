# 💊 Automedivision: A Deep Learning System for Accurate Pharmaceutical Pill Identification
   # 🔍 Overview
Automedivision is a deep learning-based system designed to accurately identify pharmaceutical pills from images using visual features like shape, color, and imprint. The goal is to assist patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers in reducing medication errors and enabling safer identification—especially in low-resource or emergency situations.

   # 🧠 Tech Stack
      Language: Python

      Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

      Model: MobileNet (Transfer Learning)

      Platform: Google Colab

   # 🎯 Key Features
      1. Achieves 90%+ accuracy in pill classification

      2. Optimized for lightweight, real-time inference

      3. Supports scenarios like mobile health, inventory systems, and emergency response

      4. Dataset preprocessing and augmentation included

      5. Clean, modular code structure with comments for clarity

   # 📌 Use Cases
      1. Medication identification for patients and pharmacists

      2. Inventory automation in pharmacies and hospitals

      3. Emergency identification in critical situations

👨‍💻 My Role
As part of my final year B.Tech project, I led this initiative by:

Designing the model architecture

Performing dataset cleaning and augmentation

Training, evaluating, and tuning the MobileNet-based classifier

Documenting the use cases and proposed real-world integration

Collaborating with team members and faculty for testing and validation
